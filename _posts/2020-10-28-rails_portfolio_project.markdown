For my rails portfolio project I decided to create a BBQ events page where users can create various events.
As we all know, portfolio projects come with a degree of difficulties. This rails project also had been impacted by other things, such as covid 19 and our PCS to Idaho which I will discuss in another post.

As difficult as it was, I had a lot of fun making it. Seeing all the knowledge acquired by the curriculum coming together is impressive.

I've used devise to create authorization and authentication. This gem is so useful, I'm glad we are allowed to use. It made it easy to implement login, and sign up. 
For my project I decided to go with Google omniauth. It took me a whole day to figure everything out how to make it work but once everything was set up appropriately, it was running flawlessly. This was a humbling experience, especially considering that there are a bunch of websites that I log in with omni auth on my own. You get to appreciate those implementations more.

Devise does come with some learning curve but there is a good community out there. Their wiki is an immense resource. Searching on Google for Devise brings up a good amount of blog posts that either go step by step or are focused on a specific problem in it.

On YouTube there are good videos how to utilize omniauth on different platforms. The video that helped me the most was made by Briant Richards, a fellow Flatiron student. He uploaded a video that is an hour long. He did step by step how to use devise to implement omniauth for Facebook, Google and Twitter. The link to the video is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dd8dOAL6WYs&t=471s&ab_channel=BryantRichards).

The whole project took longer than I expected but I learnt so much from it. I realized there is also a lot of things I have to learn, but the path is prosperous. I also know now that there is a good community behind rails and there is almost nothing you can't find a solution for. 

I am excited to start the next module on my Flatiron course.

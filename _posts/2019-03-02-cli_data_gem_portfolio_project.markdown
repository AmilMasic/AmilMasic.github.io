For my CLI Data Gem Portfolio Project I decided to scrape FineWoodworking.com. As I mentioned in my earlier blogpost, woodworking is one of my hobbies. I wanted to scrape something I like. Apart from YouTube, FineWoodworking.com has been one of my favorite resources for my woodcraft. 

The program greets the user and provides a list view of the 4 featured articles on the webpage. The user may choose to read any of the 4 articles or refresh the list. If there are no new articles the user may choose to close the program with typing exit. When an article is selected the CLI provides the user with the article title, author (if applicable) and the content of it. The size of the article depends on the type of article which can be either free or paid. 

Thanks to Avi Flombaum for creating the DailyDeal gem. My gem was heavily influenced by his CLI section. It’s a great experience to be able to watch the thought process of a master of the art. 

Thanks to Beth Schofield for checking with me if FineWoodworking would be a good webpage to scrape and for providing me all the resources to create the CLI gem. 

Thanks to my mentor, Melissa Hummelt for always being supportive and finding solutions with me to keep me on track. 

Thanks to Tauton Press for creating such an easy to scrape webpage. 

Working on this was a real pleasure. I liked the fact there haven’t been any tests, just final requirements. I do understand and appreciate the tests because without them this was made easy. I remember a few times I had the “oh yeah, I did it this way in that lab” moment. 

I’m excited to continue my path to become a full stack webdeveloper.

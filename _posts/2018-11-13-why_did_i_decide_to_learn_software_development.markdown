I was born in a small town, Sanski Most, in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Usually in a day to day conversation with an American I get the confused look and question : "Where is that?!". After living in the States for more than 18 months I've gotten used to explain geographically where it is, sometimes successfully, sometimes not so much. In the early '90s, my Homeland was in a civil war, which ended in '95. From that time Bosnia and Herzegovina was a 3rd world country that was working on getting itself back on track. 

During the war, my family was one of the lucky ones that managed to escape to Austria. In '96 my parents and grandparents decided to move back since they believed it would provide a better future for us (my sister and me). The coming years showed that this wasn't true and the situation in Bosnia was going downhill, to the point that a majority of the citizens believe it's worse now than after the war ended.

My sister moved over to Germany 4 days ago while I'm living in the States since 2017 thanks to my wife that I've met playing a mobile game. If it wasn't for software developers and the internet I wouldn't be here. My sister was able to move to Germany because her husband found a job in Frankfurt while applying online for it. Thanks to apps we keep in touch daily and we hear/see each other whenever we like. 

Two weeks ago I went back to Bosnia for the first time since leaving for USA. It was different from what I expected. I wasn't there for over 18 months, however, it didn't feel like that. Why? Because I kept in touch with them via Skype, Viber, WhatsApp and Facebook. The internet and software gave us a way to connect with friends and family on a daily basis. 

Software and the internet had been major factors in my sisters and mine life. This is just one reason I decided to learn software development.

Another reason takes me back to my High School years. I'm not sure how to properly translate the subject we were taught there into something that's being taught in USA. The subject literally translated means Informatics. The teachers were giving us lessons about the history of PCs, basics of Hardware and Software, the first programming languages, how binary, octal, decimal and hexadecimal worked. 
The thing that I remember the most had been learning to code in Turbo Pascal. The whole process at that time was strange, magical and pleasing at the same time. We didn't do much apart from doing some simple math with if else statements but it was so beautiful for a teenager that didn't had any exposure to internet. I fell in love with Turbo Pascal, I had my own copy on my old PC, however, I never got to use it because apart from the lessons I had no given problems to solve, I had no internet at home. Thanks to my laziness I never got around to improve my Pascal knowledge. 

After High School my first decision to study was Geography. I could stare at maps for days and learn details about where cities are located, how the borders of a country are shaped, learned where to place it on the map. Unfortunately, during my first year I realized that this is not a career I want to pursue, there was something wrong, I still don't know what it was, but I could feel it. I decided to drop out and take a year break. 

The next decision was to study Business Informatics in Prijedor at College of Economics and Informatics Prijedor. In this degree the focus are both Economic subjects as well Informatics. However, during my studies we just lightly touched programming and database administration. With Flatiron School I hope to develop my programming and database skills.

Third reason why I decided to learn Software development is the beauty of websites and apps. There are astonishing webpages that when I first visited them they blew my mind. Most memorable was YouTube. You want to listen to music, watch a game recap, see funny cat videos or learn something new, the first thing I would visit was and still is YouTube. After understanding how webpages work I fell in love with CSS Zen Garden. First time I saw that I spent on it over half an hour just clicking on different designs and being in awe of them. I hope one day to provide a template on it too. 

Destiny and software development got me here, into the USA. I want to give back, I want to be part of it, part of the people that make life easier for others, that make distances seem like they don't exist. I'm truly grateful for having such an opportunity in my life.

While I was watching on Learn instruct how to scrape a webpage I realized how many similarities there are between learning to code and learning to work with wood.

One of my hobbies is woodworking. I’ve been trying to learn the craft for two years now. I have successfully made kitchen knives for friends and family and a clock for my wife. I love working with wood. I love learning to make new things. 

As a Kid I remember playing with my grandfather’s tools in his shop. They were all hand tools, but to me, they were secret toys.  Around the same time we got our first computer, one that was running on a DOS system, I don’t remember exactly which, but I do remember it had many settings that you could change. The computer was also a secret toy to me. Everyone else figured out I was playing with it once the PC didn’t wanted to boot correctly. 

Things are different nowadays. I know what the tools are that I was playing in my grandfathers shop and I know to stay away from BIOS on PC’s. 

The similarities between Coding and Woodworking

I realized they have similarities while I was shaping a knife handle as a Christmas present for a family member. The thought that went through my head was how from nothing you make something, how utilizing tools, mind and hands you make it possible. In both woodworking and coding you learn the basics and apply that knowledge to advanced stages. 
In coding you learn to make a simple if statement, while, for and until loops. Add cases to it and you have all the tools needed to make any CLI. In woodworking you learn how to make a cut, use a chisel and make a joint. Combine that knowledge and you can make a square box.  
Then, there are the tools that make life easier. In coding, specifically in Ruby, they are called gems, useful code someone wrote to make life easier. In woodworking those are hand tools, that also got created by someone. 
Libraries can be compared to power tools in woodworking, they are bulky and have a lot of usability and both require some form of understanding how they function. 

Another similar aspect is the possibility of being inspired by others work. In woodworking it can be a picture on a forum, or a video on a web platform, while for a developer in might be the video web platform or forum where the before mention picture is.

Combine the mind, skills, tools, either hand or power tools and creation is only limited to your imagination, either for a webpage or a wood project. 

I’m enjoying both in my life. I’m happy to learn and create.
